# Specification Quality Checklist: Favorite Currencies

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
	- Note: The spec mentions `localStorage` because the feature request
		explicitly requested localStorage persistence. This is documented as an
		assumption in the spec (acceptable per instructions). See "Requirements"
		and "Assumptions" in `spec.md`.
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

- Checked for presence of [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers: none found in
	`spec.md`.
- Confirmed acceptance scenarios are present for P1/P2/P3 (see section
	`User Scenarios & Testing`). Example: "Given the app has no favorites,
	when the user marks EUR as favorite, then EUR appears...".
- Confirmed FRs are specific and testable (e.g., FR-003 persistence to
	`localStorage` under key `tcc.favorites` â€” tests can assert presence and
	JSON structure).
- Confirmed success criteria are measurable (SC-001, SC-002, SC-003, SC-004).
- Edge cases present: invalid JSON, storage disabled/quota, multi-tab updates.
- Assumptions documented: anonymous users, use of localStorage, no PII.

## Recommendation

- Ready for planning (`/speckit.plan`). No blockers found in the spec
	itself. CI and implementation checklist should be prepared to add unit and
	integration tests described under the Constitution Check.


## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
