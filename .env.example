# No environment variables required!

# This application works out of the box without any configuration.
# It uses free public APIs that don't require API keys.

# If you want to use your own API keys in the future, you can add them here:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# For local development, you can copy this file to .env.local
# cp .env.example .env.local
