# Refresh Rates Button Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a "Refresh Rates" button that allows users to manually fetch the latest exchange rates from the API in real-time.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Component: `RefreshButton.tsx`

- **Location**: `components/RefreshButton.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Icon-only button with green color scheme (matches SwapButton style)
  - Animated spinning refresh icon during loading state
  - Disabled state to prevent multiple simultaneous requests
  - Full accessibility support (aria-label and title attributes)
  - Responsive design matching existing UI patterns

### 2. Updated Hook: `useExchangeRates.ts`

- **Location**: `hooks/useExchangeRates.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Extracted fetch logic into `fetchRates` function using `useCallback`
  - Exposed `refreshRates` function for manual rate refresh
  - Added `cache: 'no-store'` to force fresh data on refresh
  - Simplified state management by removing manual cleanup flag

### 3. Updated Component: `ConverterForm.tsx`

- **Location**: `components/ConverterForm.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `onRefresh` prop (required)
  - Added `refreshLoading` prop (optional, defaults to false)
  - Integrated `RefreshButton` after the second currency selector
  - Button placement: After toCurrency selector, before the result display

### 4. Updated Page: `page.tsx`

- **Location**: `app/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Destructured `refreshRates` from `useExchangeRates` hook
  - Passed `refreshRates` to `ConverterForm` as `onRefresh` prop
  - Passed `loading` state as `refreshLoading` to show spinner on button
  - Updated loading condition to show spinner only on initial load, not during refresh

### 5. Updated Export: `components/index.ts`

- **Location**: `components/index.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added export for `RefreshButton` component

## Test Coverage

### New Test File: `RefreshButton.test.tsx`

- 7 tests covering all functionality:
  - ✅ Renders with correct attributes
  - ✅ Calls onClick when clicked
  - ✅ Disables button during loading
  - ✅ Prevents onClick when disabled
  - ✅ Applies spinning animation when loading
  - ✅ No animation when not loading
  - ✅ Enables button when not loading

### Updated Tests: `ConverterForm.test.tsx`

- Added 3 new tests:
  - ✅ Calls onRefresh when refresh button clicked
  - ✅ Disables refresh button when refreshLoading is true
  - ✅ Enables refresh button when refreshLoading is false
- Updated existing test to verify refresh button presence

### Updated Tests: `useExchangeRates.test.ts`

- Added 5 new tests:
  - ✅ Exposes refreshRates function
  - ✅ Refreshes rates when refreshRates is called
  - ✅ Sets loading state during refresh
  - ✅ Handles errors during refresh
  - ✅ Fetches with correct cache settings

## Test Results

- **All 110 tests passing** ✅
- **11 test suites** ✅
- **No TypeScript compilation errors** ✅

## Functionality

### User Experience

1. **Initial Load**: Exchange rates are fetched automatically when the app loads
2. **Manual Refresh**: User can click the green refresh button to fetch latest rates
3. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Button shows animated spinning icon during refresh
   - Button is disabled during refresh to prevent multiple requests
   - Form remains functional during refresh (unlike initial load)
4. **Automatic Recalculation**: After new rates are fetched, the conversion automatically updates

### Error Handling

- Errors during refresh are caught and displayed via existing error message component
- Failed refresh doesn't break the app - previous rates remain available
- Loading state is properly managed in all scenarios

### Accessibility

- Button includes `aria-label="Refresh exchange rates"`
- Button includes `title="Refresh exchange rates"` for tooltip
- Disabled state is properly communicated to screen readers
- Keyboard navigation fully supported

## Technical Details

### State Management Flow

1. User clicks refresh button
2. `refreshRates` function is called (from `useExchangeRates`)
3. `loading` state is set to `true`
4. API call is made to `/api/rates` with `cache: 'no-store'`
5. On success: `exchangeRates` state is updated with new data
6. On error: `error` state is updated with error message
7. `loading` state is set to `false`
8. `useConverter` hook automatically recalculates conversion with new rates

### Performance Considerations

- Uses `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Fetch includes `cache: 'no-store'` to ensure fresh data
- Button disabled during fetch prevents duplicate API calls
- No performance impact on existing functionality

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `hooks/useExchangeRates.ts` - Added refresh functionality
2. ✅ `components/RefreshButton.tsx` - New component
3. ✅ `components/ConverterForm.tsx` - Integrated refresh button
4. ✅ `app/page.tsx` - Connected refresh function
5. ✅ `components/index.ts` - Added export
6. ✅ `components/RefreshButton.test.tsx` - New test file
7. ✅ `components/ConverterForm.test.tsx` - Updated tests
8. ✅ `hooks/useExchangeRates.test.ts` - Updated tests

## Design Consistency

- Button matches `SwapButton` styling and size
- Uses green color scheme to distinguish from swap (blue)
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- Tailwind CSS classes consistent with project patterns
- Icon from same Heroicons library as swap button

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Auto-refresh timer (e.g., refresh every 5 minutes)
- Toast notification on successful refresh
- Display "last refreshed" timestamp
- Keyboard shortcut for refresh (e.g., Ctrl+R)
